# Example 1: Draw a line

One of the simplest things we can do using the turtle module is to draw a line.

## Code

```python
# Step 1: Make all the "turtle" commands available to us.
import turtle

# Step 2: Create a new turtle. We'll call it "luca"
luca = turtle.Turtle()

# Step 3: Move in the direction Luca's facing for 50 pixels
luca.forward(50)

# Step 4: We're done!
turtle.done()
```
